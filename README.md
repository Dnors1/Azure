# Azure Windows Images Default To en-US
By default every Windows virtual machine deployed in Azure from the marketplace will be using US regional settings. 

Timezone, Time Format, Currency and keyboard will all be in EN-US. 

I have been tasked with changing this on customer Azure environments. 

I have created an XML for English Great Britain for all to access. 

If you have any further XML requirements please feel free to post them and I will add them to the repository.
